## Rules

> The game consists of pairs of cards with identical pictures. All the cards are shuffled and laid out face down on the table. In turn, each player turns over two cards of their choice. If they > > find two identical cards, they pick them up and keep them, allowing them to play again. If the cards are not identical, they are turned face down to their original position.
>
> The game ends when all pairs of cards have been found and collected. The winner is the player with the most pairs.
